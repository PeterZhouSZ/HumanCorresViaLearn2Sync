# Dependencies.
This project is tested on Python `3.7.7`. It depends on PyTorch `1.4+cu100`, [Pytorch Geometric (torch_geometric)](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) `1.4.3` , [Open3D (open3d)](http://www.open3d.org) `0.9.0.0`, torch_sparse `0.6.1`, torch_cluster `1.5.4`, torch_scatter `2.0.4`, torch_spline_conv `1.2.0`.
Multiple GPUs are preferred for best performance.

**If you would like our code to work on different configurations, feel free to file an issue. :)**
